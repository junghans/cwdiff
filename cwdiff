A colorized version of (w)diff, which can be used a wrapper script, too.
$usage

Options:
 -f, --filter         Act as a wdiff color filter only and don't execute diff/wdiff
                      internally, just colorize input (no ARGS = read from stdin)
 -d, --diff           Preprocess input with diff and before giving it to wdiff
                      (very useful for dirs). Option can be used in combination
                      with --filter option meaning input is a patch.
 -D, --diffonly       Process input with diff, but NOT with wdiff, so ${0##*/}
                      basically acts like a colorized version of diff. Option
                      can be used in combination with --filter option meaning
                      input is a patch.
     --diffopts XXX   Change options given to diff. The default is '$diff_opts'.
     --ab             Replace common trunc of dirname by 'a' and 'b'
     --no-color       Disable color
     --               Stop parsing options
 -h, --help           Show this help
 -v, --version        Show version

Examples:
 ${0##*/} -d dir1 dir2                     Compare two directories
 ${0##*/} file1 file2                      Compare two files
 ${0##*/} --ab -D dir1 dir2                VCS like output from compaing two directories
 wdiff file1 file2 | ${0##*/} -f           Colorize the output of wdiff
 diff -u file1 file2 | ${0##*/} -D -f      Colorize the output of diff
